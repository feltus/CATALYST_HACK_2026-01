# CATALYST HACKATHON (2026-01-30)::: Testing the Palmetto2 bioLLM infrastructure prototype.

## PreHack.  
Provide hackers access to bioLLM ecosystem and usage documentation..

## Background. 
Members of the CCIT-RCDE division and faculty from Clemson Genetics & Biochemistry Department, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department, Electrical and Computer Engineering department and the School of Computing have joined forces to create comprehensive biological Large Language Model (bioLLM) ecosystem at Clemson University to address the growing demand for AI-powered life sciences research tools.

Building upon recent advances in biological foundation models, Stanford's Biomni framework, and openAI LLM middleware (codex, MCP server), the team has created an extensible, locally-deployed AI platform prototype operating on Clemson's Palmetto2 HPC cluster. The ecosystem addresses current limitations in fragmented bioinformatics tools, scalability, security, and sustainability. Through an innovative agentic framework, Clemson researchers will gain access to specialized bioLLMs for genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and systems biology applications. 

In order to facilitate usage and harden this system, we will be hosting hackathons in 2026 with exclusive access to the bioLLM ecosystem.  The first hackathon will be a small group of hackers that will test prompt the agentic bioLLM system to perform scientific discovery, usage documentation, and identify gaps in the system.

## When? 
The first Hackathon will be a week-long asynchronous event from Jan 30 (Fri) - Feb 6 (Fri). There will be synchronous Zoom meetings 9am-10am each Friday.

## Hackathon Charge. 
Design an experiment and test the agent's ability to generate useful results from 2 core pipelines.. The first pipeline identifies genes and their protein products underlying a specific phenotype.  The second pipeline identifies small molecules that interact with those proteins.  The methods will be documented and results of the project will be quantified for accuracy.
