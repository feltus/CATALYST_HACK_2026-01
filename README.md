## Pre-Hack  
1.	Add users to OpenAi and bioLLM (Carl)
2.	Obtain OpenAI account with your clemson.edu email (not g.clemson.edu) (user)
3.  Install codex with https://git.rcd.clemson.edu/biollms/biocodex

## Background 
Members of the CCIT-RCDE division and faculty from Clemson Genetics & Biochemistry Department, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Department, Electrical and Computer Engineering department and the School of Computing have joined forces to create modular poly-domain research generative AI ecosystem on Palmetto2 called Clemson Advanced Computational Analytics and Learning for Integrated Science Translation(CATALYST) Phase one of CATALYST development is applying the system to Life Science research facet (bioLLM).

Building upon recent advances in biological foundation models, Stanford's Biomni framework, and openAI LLM middleware (codex, MCP server), the team has created an extensible, locally-deployed AI platform prototype operating on Clemson's Palmetto2 HPC cluster. The ecosystem addresses current limitations in fragmented bioinformatics tools, scalability, security, and sustainability. Through an innovative agentic framework, Clemson researchers will gain access to specialized bioLLMs for genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and systems biology applications. 

In order to facilitate usage and harden this system, we will be hosting hackathons in 2026 with exclusive access to alpha test bioLLM ecosystem.  The first hackathon will be a small group of hackers that will test prompt the agentic bioLLM system to perform scientific discovery, usage documentation, and identify gaps in the system.

## When & Where
The first Hackathon will be a week-long asynchronous event from Jan 30 (Fri) - Feb 6 (Fri). 
There will be synchronous Zoom meetings 9am-10am each Friday: https://clemson.zoom.us/j/9452064261
Feltus will be in Zoom 9am to noon each day.

## Collaboration. 
Discord server: https://discord.gg/V4p7Sd8t  

## Hackathon Charge 
Design an experimental workflow to test the OpenAI LLM and bioLLM agent ability to generate useful results from existing tools. Gaps will be documented and submitted as issues at https://git.rcd.clemson.edu/biollms/biocodex.
